LilGrid For Compass
=============================

I suspect you do not actually want to use this for anything yet. I am
in the process of making a new compass plugin while deconstructing the Less
Framwork Compass Plugin (which is pretty stellar). Come back later if you want
to see how I modified it.

This CSS Framework started as a fork of the Less Framework Compass Plugin.
